# SIGNAL-DETECTION-BB-and-RSI-buy and sell signal
 the project titled ”Detection of Bollinger Bands and RSI Buy/Sell Signals using Deep Learning”. The focus of the project was
 to develop a deep learning model for the detection of financial signals, particularly Bollinger
 Bands and the Relative Strength Index (RSI), based on stock price data.
 For training the model, I used RoboFlow 
The precision of Bolinger Band is about 90%
and that of RSI is 93%
 The objectives of the project included:
 • Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering and preparing historical stock price
 data for the deep learning model.
 • Model Development: Designing and implementing a deep learning model to detect
 Bollinger Bands and RSI buy/sell signals.
 • Dataset Expansion: Expanding the dataset to include diverse stock price charts for
 better model performance.
 • Model Evaluation and Results: Evaluating the model’s performance and fine-tuning
 it for optimal results.
